## üöÄ Quick Start
A detailed Quick Start is written in our [Contributing Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md). You can go through it for more details. 

### API Monitoring Dashboard

This project now includes a complete API Monitoring Dashboard with:

1. **Flask Backend** (`server/`)
   - Tracks every request's endpoint name, HTTP method, response status code, and response time
   - Provides endpoints for metrics, recent logs, and health checks
   - Stores metrics in memory (no external database required)

2. **React/TypeScript Frontend** (`client/dashboard/`)
   - Modern dashboard with real-time updates (auto-refresh every 30 seconds)
   - Summary cards with total requests, average latency, and error rate
   - Table of endpoints with metrics
   - Interactive charts visualizing request trends and latency
   - Responsive design with ShadCN UI components

### Running the Dashboard

**Backend (Flask):**
```bash
# Navigate to the server directory
cd server

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the server
python app.py
# Server will start on http://localhost:5000
```

**Frontend (React/TypeScript):**
```bash
# Navigate to the client/dashboard directory
cd client/dashboard

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run dev
# Dashboard will be available at http://localhost:8080
```
