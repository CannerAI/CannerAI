## 🏗 Architecture

Here’s an overview of how **Canner** works internally:

The Canner system is designed with a clear client-server model, containerized for efficient deployment and scalability.

---

🔍 Overview
Canner consists of three main components — the Client (Browser Extension), Server (Flask API inside Docker), and Database Layer.

Here’s how they work together:

🧩 1. Client / Browser Extension
• Built using React App and integrated browser storage.
• Interacts directly with LinkedIn, where users can trigger AI-assisted content suggestions.
• Includes:
    • Popup Interface – The main UI for users to select and generate responses.
    • Welcome Page – The onboarding or landing view for new users.
• Sends HTTP requests (GET, POST, PUT, UPDATE, DELETE) to the backend through NGINX for processing.

⚙️ 2. Server (Flask + NGINX inside Docker)
• The backend is managed by a Flask Server, hosted in a Docker container behind NGINX.
• Flask API Endpoints:
    • api/responses
    • api/health
    • api/responses/<id>
• The server uses a Response Model containing:
    • id, title, content, tags, createdAt, updatedAt
• Handles Logs / Errors and uses environment variables such as:
    • PORT, Database_url, FLASK_DEBUG, FLASK_APP, SECRET_KEY
• Implements CORS for secure cross-origin communication.

🗄️ 3. Database Layer
• The backend supports two database configurations:
• Postgres (default) – runs on port 5432
• SQLite (response.db) – fallback option if Database_url is not defined
• PG Admin is used for database administration and runs on port 8080.

🔁 Flow Summary
1. The user interacts with LinkedIn through the browser extension.
2. The extension communicates with the Flask API (via NGINX) to request or store AI-generated responses.
3. The server processes the request, manages response data in the database, and returns results to the client.
